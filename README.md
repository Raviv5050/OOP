Project Description
-
Arkanoid is a 1986 block breaker arcade game developed.
Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the Vaus, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield. Some blocks may be indestructible or require multiple hits to break.
In this project, I worked on several features:
I created the arachnoid game in a gradual process throughout the semester.
The game contains several stages. The difficulty level increases in higher stages.


The different screens
-
The main screen has a graphic display which runs the Arkanoid game:

### Running
To run, enter to the "ass5" folder then click (double click) on the file: main.exe. A window will open that will display the 10 solutions of the hexagon board, and finally the Arkanoid game will be displayed.
